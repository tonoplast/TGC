# TGC
Theta-gamma coupling used for individualised intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in the prefrontal cortex.

This code is a simplied version for individualised iTBS protocols.
Arduino, an open‐source microcontroller platform was used (https://www.arduino.cc/) for delivery of iTBS, 
and the code is included in this repository (dynamic_TBS.ino).

More detailed version will be uploaded soon.
